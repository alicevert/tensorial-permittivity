# Tensorial Permittivity Simulation
This is a program that estimates the components of the dielectric permittivity tensor of an anisotropic material.
The input parameters are core radius (b), shell thickness (d), and planar number density (1/m^2) of the nanoparticles, as well as the magnitude of the magnetic flux density (B) applied to the sample.
The outputs are the components εXX and εXY of the permittivity tensor as a function of wavelength. To get the εZZ component, run the function again inputting B=0 and the output εXX=εZZ [1].
The Tensorial Permittivity Simulation function is adapted from the Absorption Simulation function by Kenzie Lewis and Raaja Rajeshwari Manickam, based off algorithm by Dani et al. [2]

## Before running the simulation
Edit the Tensorial Permittivity Simulation file to suit your needs. 
Depending on whether a single wavelength (e.g., 532 nm) or a wavelength sweep (e.g., 200 to 900 nm) is being used, comment out the irrelevant parts.
Make sure the fitted parameters (for the core - SnO2) are up to date with the most recent experimental data.
Comment out the parameters for the magneto-optically (gyrotropically) anisotropic material that's not of interest (either SnO2 or Fe2O3).
All the units are SI and the angles are in radians.

## Running the simulation
Run the function in the Get Permittivity Tensor file. This script runs the function and formats the outputs in an excel table and plot.
